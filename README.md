# FPGA-UARTFIFO
This project is my work at Digital Design Camp in year 2018 to use FPGA with transceiver module to create UART communication.

Components that I worked with in this project 
- RxSerial (Receiver entity)
- TxSerial (Transmitter entity)
- UARTFIFO (Portmap module/Top level)
- FIFO (fifo4kx8 create from IP catalog)
- Testbench for Tx and Rx
